# Awesome LLM Prompt Reading List

This Reading List is still **updating**. 

Any stars, questions or PRs are sincerely appreciated and welcomed.

With the fast developement of LLM, researchers tend to prompt LLM to utilize the world knowledge and reasoning ability of LLM by prompting it better. This reading list mainly focuses on papers of different effective prompting methods to enhance the performance of LLM on various tasks.
